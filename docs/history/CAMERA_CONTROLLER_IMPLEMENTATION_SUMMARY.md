## Features Implemented

### 1. Seven View Modes

**Perspective** (Default)
- Standard 3D first-person camera
- Full freedom of movement
- Mouse look controls

**Top** (Orthographic)
- Looking down (Y-)
- Pitch: -90°, Yaw: 0°
- Best for: Layout design, overhead planning

**Front** (Orthographic)
- Looking forward (Z-)
- Pitch: 0°, Yaw: -90°
- Best for: Front-facing details, Z-axis alignment

**Side / Right** (Orthographic)
- Looking right (X-)
- Pitch: 0°, Yaw: 0°
- Best for: Side profiles, X-axis alignment

**Bottom** (Orthographic)
- Looking up (Y+)
- Pitch: 90°, Yaw: 0°
- Best for: Underside inspection

**Back** (Orthographic)
- Looking back (Z+)
- Pitch: 0°, Yaw: 90°
- Best for: Rear details

**Left** (Orthographic)
- Looking left (X+)
- Pitch: 0°, Yaw: 180°
- Best for: Left-side profiles

### 2. Focus on Selection (F Key)

**Functionality**:
- Calculates center point of all selected blocks
- Maintains current camera viewing direction
- Moves camera to view selection from current angle
- Preserves distance or uses optimal distance
- Smooth transition (optional)

**Usage**:
```cpp
// Keyboard: Press F key when selection exists
// API: editorManager->focusOnSelection();
// Direct: cameraController->focusOn(target, distance);
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Calculates average position of selected blocks
- Uses glm::vec3 for position math
- Logs operation to console for debugging
- No-op if no selection exists

### 3. Frame Selection

**Functionality**:
- Calculates bounding box of selection (min/max corners)
- Computes required viewing distance based on FOV
- Moves camera to optimal viewing distance
- Adds 20% padding for comfortable viewing

**Mathematical Formula**:
```cpp
float maxDimension = max(size.x, size.y, size.z);
float distance = maxDimension / (2.0f * tan(radians(fov * 0.5f)));
distance *= 1.2f; // Add 20% padding
```

**Usage**:
```cpp
// Via EditorManager
editorManager->frameSelection();

// Via CameraController
cameraController->frameBox(min, max);
cameraController->frameSphere(center, radius);
```

### 4. Camera Bookmarks

**Bookmark Structure**:
```cpp
struct Bookmark {
    std::string name;      // User-defined name
    glm::vec3 position;    // Camera position
    float pitch;           // Pitch angle
    float yaw;             // Yaw angle
    ViewMode viewMode;     // View mode
};
```

**Operations**:
- Save: `saveBookmark(name)` - Save current camera state
- Load: `loadBookmark(name)` - Restore saved state
- Delete: `deleteBookmark(name)` - Remove bookmark
- List: `getBookmarks()` - Get all bookmarks

**File Persistence** (CSV Format):
```csv
# Fresh Voxel Engine - Camera Bookmarks
# Format: name,posX,posY,posZ,pitch,yaw,viewMode
MainView,0.0,100.0,0.0,-45.0,0.0,0
SideDetail,50.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3
```

**Methods**:
- `saveBookmarksToFile(filename)` - Save to file
- `loadBookmarksFromFile(filename)` - Load from file

### 5. Camera Speed Controls

**Three Speed Presets**:
1. **Normal Speed**: 10.0 units/sec (default movement)
2. **Fast Speed**: 30.0 units/sec (rapid traversal)
3. **Slow Speed**: 3.0 units/sec (precise work)

**API**:
```cpp
setNormalSpeed(10.0f);
setFastSpeed(30.0f);
setSlowSpeed(3.0f);
applySpeedToPlayer();
```

**Integration**:
- Normal speed → Player::setWalkSpeed()
- Fast speed → Player::setSprintSpeed()

### 6. Smooth Transitions

**Features**:
- Optional smooth interpolation between positions
- Configurable duration (default: 0.3 seconds)
- Smooth easing function (ease in-out)
- Shortest-path yaw interpolation

**API**:
```cpp
setSmoothTransitions(true);
setTransitionDuration(0.3f);
```

**Implementation**:
- Update() called each frame
- Smooth ease function: t * t * (3 - 2*t)
- Handles yaw wrapping for shortest rotation
- Stops automatically when complete

   - Calls EditorManager::focusOnSelection()
   - Integrated with W/E/R shortcuts

4. **SelectionManager**:

   - Used for bounding box calculation

### Memory Management

- CameraController uses std::unique_ptr in EditorManager
- Bookmark vector managed by CameraController
- No manual memory allocation
- RAII principles throughout

### Error Handling

- Null pointer checks for player and camera
- Validates bookmark operations
- Logs warnings for invalid operations
- Returns success/failure booleans
- No-op if preconditions not met
