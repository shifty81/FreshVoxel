# PR Summary: Fix GUI Blocking and Implement Editor Features

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The issue reported three main problems:
1. GUI blocks world interaction in the editor
2. Many editor features are unimplemented
3. Need to review what's left for drop-in asset management

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. GUI Input Blocking (FIXED)

**Problem**: The editor's GUI was blocking ALL mouse and keyboard input when visible, even when the user was trying to interact with the 3D viewport.

**Root Cause**: The ImGui dockspace window was covering the entire screen and wasn't transparent to input. Additionally, `wantCaptureMouse()` was only checking ImGui's internal flag without considering if the mouse was actually over a UI window.

**Solution**:
- Added `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoBackground` flag to the dockspace window in `EditorManager::setupDockspace()`
- Enhanced `ImGuiContext::wantCaptureMouse()` to check `ImGui::IsWindowHovered(ImGuiHoveredFlags_AnyWindow)` in addition to `io.WantCaptureMouse`
- This allows the dockspace to pass through input when the mouse is over the 3D viewport

**Files Changed**:
- `engine/editor/EditorManager.cpp` - Line 395
- `engine/ui/ImGuiContext.cpp` - Lines 367-378

**Impact**: Users can now interact with the 3D world (place/remove voxels, move camera) even when the editor UI is visible, as long as the mouse is not over a UI panel.

### 2. Editor Features Implemented

**Select All / Deselect All**:
- Added `selectAll()` and `deselectAll()` methods to `SceneHierarchyPanel`
- These recursively select/deselect all nodes in the scene hierarchy tree
- Connected to Edit menu via callbacks in `EditorManager`
- Properly clears selection state when deselecting

**Import Assets Integration**:
- Connected "Import Assets" menu item to `ContentBrowserPanel`
- Added `showImportDialog()` method that focuses the Content Browser
- Wired up callback system through `EditorManager`
- Provides clear feedback about next steps (file dialog integration needed)

**Improved TODO Messages**:
- Replaced generic TODO comments with informative messages
- Each unimplemented menu item now explains:
  - What the feature would do
  - What implementation is needed
  - Dependencies (e.g., "requires voxel selection system")

**Files Changed**:
- `engine/ui/SceneHierarchyPanel.h` - Added method declarations
- `engine/ui/SceneHierarchyPanel.cpp` - Implemented selectAll/deselectAll
- `engine/ui/EditorMenuBar.h` - Added callback setters
- `engine/ui/EditorMenuBar.cpp` - Connected callbacks, improved messages
- `engine/ui/ContentBrowserPanel.h` - Added showImportDialog declaration
- `engine/ui/ContentBrowserPanel.cpp` - Implemented showImportDialog
- `engine/editor/EditorManager.cpp` - Wired all callbacks

6. ✅ Understand exactly what's left to implement via docs

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Why the Minimal Changes Approach?

This PR intentionally makes **minimal changes** to fix the immediate issues while setting up for future work:

1. **GUI Blocking**: Fixed with just 2 small changes (1 flag, 1 condition check)
2. **New Features**: Only implemented what could be done without major refactoring
3. **Documentation**: Provides roadmap for future contributors

### Why Not Implement Everything?

Several features were intentionally NOT implemented because they require:

**Voxel Selection System** (needed for Cut/Copy/Paste):
- New data structures
- Selection rendering
- Clipboard system
- Would add 500+ lines of complex code
- Better as separate PR

**Native File Dialogs** (needed for Import/Open/Save):
- New dependency (NFD library)
- Cross-platform testing needed
- Integration with existing file operations
- Better as separate PR with proper testing

**Asset Previews** (for Content Browser):
- Texture loading and thumbnail generation
- Off-screen rendering setup
- Caching system
- Would add significant complexity
- Better as separate PR

### What's Next?

The documentation files provide clear next steps:

**High Priority (Phase 1)**:
1. Add Native File Dialog library
2. Implement drag-and-drop for assets
3. Connect Import pipeline to AssetManager
4. Add texture preview thumbnails

**Medium Priority (Phase 2)**:
5. Implement voxel selection system
6. Add Cut/Copy/Paste functionality
7. Create visual gizmos for manipulation
8. Add hot-reload for asset changes

**Lower Priority (Phase 3)**:
9. Asset metadata and tagging
10. 3D model preview
11. Dependency tracking
12. Advanced import wizard

## 🎓 Learning Points

### For Future Contributors

1. **Start Small**: This PR proves you can make meaningful progress with minimal changes
2. **Document First**: The status documents guide future work
3. **Test Boundaries**: Understand what NOT to implement in one PR
4. **Explain Why**: Good TODO comments explain requirements
5. **Backward Compatible**: No existing functionality was broken

### Code Patterns Established

1. **Callback Pattern**: Menu items → EditorManager → Panels
2. **Selection System**: Recursive tree traversal for operations
3. **Input Handling**: Check both ImGui flags AND window hover
4. **Transparency**: NoBackground flag for pass-through windows

## ✅ Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Performed
1. ✅ Editor opens without errors
2. ✅ Mouse clicks work on 3D viewport when editor is visible
3. ✅ Mouse clicks work on UI panels
