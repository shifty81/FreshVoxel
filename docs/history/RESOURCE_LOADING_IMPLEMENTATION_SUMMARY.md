## Technical Details

### Vertex Structure
```cpp
struct Vertex {
    glm::vec3 position;
    glm::vec3 normal;
    glm::vec2 texCoord;
    glm::vec3 tangent;
    glm::vec3 bitangent;
    glm::vec4 color;
};
```

### Class Hierarchy
```
Model
  └─ Mesh (multiple)
      ├─ Vertices (vector<Vertex>)
      ├─ Indices (vector<uint32_t>)
      ├─ Material (shared_ptr)
      ├─ VertexBuffer (GPU, pending)
      └─ IndexBuffer (GPU, pending)
```

### Integration Points

**Current State:**
- CPU-side loading: ✅ Complete
- Error handling: ✅ Complete
- Logging: ✅ Integrated
- Testing: ✅ Comprehensive

**Pending Integration:**
- GPU texture upload: ⚠️ Requires RenderContext backend
- GPU mesh buffers: ⚠️ Requires RenderContext backend
- Material system: ⚠️ Partial (MTL loading needed)
- Resource caching: ⚠️ Framework exists

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Texture Loading
- **Memory:** Temporary allocation during load, freed after GPU upload
- **Formats:** All stb_image supported formats (automatic detection)
- **Channel conversion:** Automatic to RGBA8

### Model Loading
- **Vertex optimization:** Enabled by default (deduplication)
- **Memory:** In-memory vertex/index arrays
- **OBJ parsing:** Single-pass with tinyobjloader
- **Tangent calculation:** Per-triangle basis

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Image loading implementation (proven with stb_image)
- Model loading implementation (proven with tinyobjloader)
- Test coverage (comprehensive)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- GPU integration (backend-specific, complex)
- Performance with large models (needs profiling)
- Material system integration (MTL parsing needed)

### High Risk ❌
- None currently identified

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Header-only libraries are ideal** - stb_image integration was seamless
2. **Separate GPU concerns** - Keeping CPU/GPU separation clean for easier backend integration
3. **Test early** - Having tests before GPU integration helps validate data flow
4. **Documentation accuracy matters** - Updating docs revealed actual project state
5. **Minimal changes work best** - Surgical additions without breaking existing code

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ Continue with Week 7 (Audio Format Support)
2. ✅ Keep GPU integration separate (Week 8)
3. ✅ Maintain test coverage for new features
4. ✅ Update documentation as we go

### Future Considerations
1. Consider Assimp for more model formats (FBX, GLTF, etc.)
2. Implement resource streaming for large worlds
3. Add LOD (Level of Detail) system for models
4. Implement texture compression (DDS, KTX)
5. Add profiling for resource loading performance

---

## Conclusion

Weeks 5-6 of the IMMEDIATE_ACTION_PLAN have been successfully completed. The resource loading system now supports images and models on the CPU side, with clear pathways for GPU integration. The project is on track for the next phase of gameplay system implementation.

**Status: ✅ Ready to proceed with Week 7**
