### Your First Task: Voxel Selection - Day 1

**Goal for Today:** Create the SelectionManager class

1. **Create header file** `engine/editor/SelectionManager.h`:
   ```cpp
   #pragma once
   #include <vector>
   #include <glm/glm.hpp>
   #include "voxel/VoxelTypes.h"
   
   struct VoxelPosition {
       int x, y, z;
       // Operators for map/set
   };
   
   class SelectionManager {
   public:
       SelectionManager();
       
       // Selection operations
       void startSelection(const glm::vec3& worldPos);
       void updateSelection(const glm::vec3& worldPos);
       void finalizeSelection();
       void clearSelection();
       
       // Query
       bool hasSelection() const;
       size_t getSelectionSize() const;
       const std::vector<VoxelPosition>& getSelectedVoxels() const;
       
       // Manipulation
       void deleteSelected();
       void moveSelection(const glm::ivec3& delta);
       
   private:
       std::vector<VoxelPosition> m_selectedVoxels;
       glm::vec3 m_selectionStart;
       glm::vec3 m_selectionEnd;
       bool m_isSelecting;
   };
   ```

2. **Create implementation** `engine/editor/SelectionManager.cpp`:
   ```cpp
   #include "editor/SelectionManager.h"
   #include <algorithm>
   
   SelectionManager::SelectionManager()
       : m_isSelecting(false)
   {
   }
   
   void SelectionManager::startSelection(const glm::vec3& worldPos)
   {
       m_selectionStart = worldPos;
       m_selectionEnd = worldPos;
       m_isSelecting = true;
       m_selectedVoxels.clear();
   }
   
   void SelectionManager::updateSelection(const glm::vec3& worldPos)
   {
       if (!m_isSelecting) return;
       
       m_selectionEnd = worldPos;
       
       // TODO: Update selected voxels based on box from start to end
   }
   
   void SelectionManager::finalizeSelection()
   {
       m_isSelecting = false;
       // TODO: Build final list of selected voxels
   }
   
   // ... implement other methods
   ```

3. **Add to CMakeLists.txt**:
   ```cmake
   # In the editor section
   engine/editor/SelectionManager.h
   engine/editor/SelectionManager.cpp
   ```

4. **Test compilation**:
   ```bash
   cd build
   cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
   ```

**Congratulations!** You've started the voxel selection system. Tomorrow you'll add the box selection algorithm.
